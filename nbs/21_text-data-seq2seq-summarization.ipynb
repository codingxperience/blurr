Barack Obama's latest campaign gambit follows a familiar line of attack as it uses Mitt Romney's private equity past to cast the Republican candidate as  greedy, job-killing corporate titan with little concern for the working class. The President is not the first of Mr Romney's opponents to try and paint the former governor of Massachusetts as a heartless uber-capitalist - even his Republican rivals used the same tactic during the heated primary battle. But Mr Obama's campaign seems to have been particularly unoriginal - as his attack ad is almost identical to one produced by Ted Kennedy for his Senate campaign against Mr Romney in 1994, featuring unemployed workers complaining about Bain Capital, the firm founded by Mr Romney. The timing of the Obama assault on private equity is also unfortunate, as on Monday night the President attended a fundraiser hosted by Democratic supporter Ham</td>\n",

Since the birth of the tea party movement in 2009, primary challenges from the right have produced major headlines and headaches for the GOP and hurt the party's chances of winning back the Senate from Democrats in the past two election cycles.

AZUZ: First up, it's the biggest expansion of the United States health care system in more than forty years. And by a vote of 219-212, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a health care reform bill late Sunday night. This is the same bill that the Senate passed last December. This means that when President Obama signs it, it's law. The House also passed a set of changes to the Senate bill. We're gonna get back to that in just a second.

President Barack Obama declared Friday that a surface-to-air missile blasted the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 on Thursday over the Donetsk region of Ukraine near the Russian border. According to a senior American official, a U.S. radar system saw a surface-to-air missile system turn on and track an aircraft right before plane went down. A second system saw a heat signature, which would indicate a missile rising from the ground into the air at the time the airliner was hit, the official explained. Does anyone dispute that?

The twin threats of climate change and human encroachment on natural environments are, however, threatening the existence of the country's rich wildlife. And there is a great deal to lose. In the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) World Conservation Monitoring Centre's list of megadiverse countries Mexico ranks 11th. The list represents a group of 17 countries that harbor the majority of the Earth's species and are therefore considered extremely biodiverse. From its coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea to its tropical jungles in Chiapas and the Yucatan peninsula and its deserts and prairies in the north, Mexico boasts an incredibly rich variety of flora and fauna. Some 574 out of 717 reptile species found in Mexico -- the most in any country -- can only be encountered within its borders.

Facing few political consequences in California where her Senate seat is firmly in her grasp, Feinstein, 81, was defiant as she took the Senate floor Tuesday to announce the release of a 525-page summary of the Intelligence Committee's report on the CIA's treatment of detainees â€”the product of five years of line-by-line scrutiny of some six million internal government documents.
